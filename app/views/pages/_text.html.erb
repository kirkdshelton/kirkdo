<p>I have been drawing and creating things from a very early age. I read somewhere that all of us are artist when we are children. However, over time we struggle to keep that sense of creativity as we transition into adulthood. This is something I have fought over the years. I find that I am at my best when I am able to create.

I enjoy switching up between the mediums of web design and print design. Each medium has their own set of boundaries and freedoms. I am happy as long as the end result serves a purpose. I have a simple design philosophy, and that is, don’t make something unless it’s necessary and useful. Once I have that accomplished, then make that particular thing beautiful.</p>
